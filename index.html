          <br>
            <p>The University of Missouri-Columbia has a variety of opportunities and ways to make Mizzou feel more like a home away from home. One way to start your journey at Mizzou is by getting involved â€“ in and outside of the classroom. Ultimately, it's up to you! But stick around for a walk through on what involvement can look like, the benefits of involvement, and ways to kickstart <em>your</em> journey. <em>M-I-Z!</em></p>

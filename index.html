    <h1>Brooke Lincoln, University of Missouri 2022 Graduate</h1>
    <h2>Interested in project management, sales and visual storytelling</h2>
    <p> Hello, my name is Brooke Lincoln. I’m a strategic communication student with journalism, marketing and professional work experience at the University of Missouri. I’m currently learning about web accessibility, user experience and marketing campaigns in my last semester of undergrad. I would love to find a role as a project manager focused on user experience or analyst relations.</p>

    <p> I am always interested in learning more about consulting opportunities, user research and experience, video production and both corporate or nonprofit communications. I’ve created a variety of projects during my time as a Mizzou tiger ranging from broadcast journalism stories and marketing campaign materials to presentations, training materials and marketing videos. Check out my projects, resume and please feel free to <a href="mailto:brooke.lincoln@outlook.com" target="_blank">send me a message!</a> I’d love to chat.</p>
